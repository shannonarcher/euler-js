/*
Even Fibonacci numbers
Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

let prev = 1, curr = 2;
let sum = curr;
const max = 4 * Math.pow(10, 6);

while (curr < max) {
  // swap prev and curr
  curr = curr + prev;
  prev = curr - prev;
  curr = curr - prev;

  // find next number in sequence
  curr += prev;

  // add current value to sum
  sum += curr % 2 ? 0 : curr;
}

console.log(`Sum of even numbered terms in Fibonacci sequence under ${max.toLocaleString()} is ${sum.toLocaleString()}`);
